# webTest

This is a basic working example with images and some components to illustrate how the react native init app can be transformed with the help of react-native-web library. 

It does include Colors and Header but not DebugInstructions, LearnMoreLinks and ReloadInstructions from react-native/Libraries/NewAppScreen components.
